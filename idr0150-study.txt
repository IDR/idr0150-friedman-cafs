Study Title	Cancer-associated fibroblast compositions change with breast cancer progression linking the ratio of S100A4+ and PDPN+ CAFs to clinical outcome			
Study Type	multiplexed immunofluorescence

Study Description	Tumors are supported by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are heterogeneous and carry out distinct cancer-associated functions. Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment. Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.

Protocol Description	Sample Description: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues represented in tissue arrays. Processed data were obtained using Fiji and the 'rolling ball' method.	
Quantification Process: Quantification of TMA staining was performed using the Fiji image processing platform. ROIs were manually depicted to include all intact tissue areas and exclude regions of adipose tissue (due to nonspecific staining). H&Es from the TNBC TMA were used to assist in training and optimizing this step. Following background subtraction using a rolling ball with a radius of 200 pixels, the CK, S100A4 and PDPN channels were thresholded using Otsu method. All pixels above the threshold were counted as 1, and their sum was divided by the ROI. Channel/ROI scores of all replicate cores from the same patient (typically three) were averaged and the average score was used for statistical analysis. Ratios between different stains were calculated for each core and averaged for each patient.
